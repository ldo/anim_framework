anim_framework is a set of Python 3 classes for constructing non-real-time animations
using Cairo graphics. The module anim_common contains common definitions for managing
time and drawing, while additional modules anim_lissa, anim_rose and anim_troch build
on this to render animations of Lissajous, rose and trochoid curves respectively.

anim_common provides a convenience routine, render_anim, which will render out an
entire animation to a sequence of numbered PNG frames. These can then be re-encoded through
a tool like FFmpeg <http://ffmpeg.org> into any convenient delivery format, like
OGV, MPEG-4 etc.

To illustrate the process, let’s start by defining some example parameters: the duration
of the animation in seconds, the width and height of each frame, the frame rate, and the
number of linear steps used to approximate curves:

    anim_duration = 10.0
    width = 1280
    height = 720
    frame_rate = 25.0
    nr_steps = 500

Now let’s make a simple animating Lissajous curve:

    lissa = anim_lissa.make_draw \
      (
        x_amp = 300,
        x_freq = 2,
        x_phase = anim_common.linear_interpolator(0, anim_duration, 0, 1),
        y_amp = 300,
        y_freq = 3,
        y_phase = 0,
        nr_steps = nr_steps,
      )

Note that in this example all the parameters are constant, except for the x_phase, which is
set to vary linearly from 0 to 1 over the entire duration of the animation. In general,
any curve parameter can be either a constant value or the result of evaluating a time-dependent
interpolator. The framework provides a range of basic interpolator types, as well as
functions for transforming and combining them in various ways, and it is easy enough to
define your own. So long as you put your custom interpolators through anim_common.interpolator
(which can be used as a decorator), the framework will treat them exactly like built-in
interpolators.

The result returned by the above make_draw call is a “draw procedure”, which is a procedure
that takes two arguments: a Cairo graphics context, and the current time. It does whatever
is necessary to render the image into that context at that time. The framework provides
functions for combining draw procedures, remapping them through time, etc. And of course
you can define your own.

And finally we can render the curve out to actual images:

    def anim_init(g) :
        g.translate(width / 2, height / 2)
        g.set_source_rgb(1, 1, 1)
        g.paint()
        g.set_source_rgb(*colorsys.hsv_to_rgb(0.25, 0.9, 0.9))
        g.set_line_width(4)
    #end anim_init

    anim_common.render_anim \
      (
        width = width,
        height = height,
        start_time = 0.0,
        end_time = anim_duration,
        frame_rate = frame_rate,
        draw_frame = lissa,
        overall_presetup = anim_init,
        out_dir = "frames",
        start_frame_nr = 1
      )

which will run for a few seconds or so to generate 250 frames. This requires that a
subdirectory called “frames” be created, into which the frames will be written under
the names “0001.png”, “0002.png” etc. The FFmpeg package provides the “ffplay” command,
which can directly play the PNG frames using a command like

    ffplay -autoexit frames/%04d.png

or, if you want playback to loop:

    ffplay -loop 0 frames/%04d.png

Note the definition of anim_init, which is called by render_anim after it creates the
Cairo drawing context but before rendering any frames, in order to do any special setup
that you need. Here it sets the drawing origin to the centre of the frame (for positioning
the curve), clears the background to white, and sets a pen colour and size for the curve.
HSV tends to be a more convenient space for experimenting with colours than RGB, which is
why I use the hsv_to_rgb conversion provided by the standard Python library.

If you try playing back the resulting animation from the above, it won’t look right.
What happens is that the Lissajous curves from previous frames remain on succeeding
frames instead of being erased, until the result at the end of the animation is a solid
green square.

What you want is to start with a white background for each frame. This can be done
with a custom draw procedure as simple as

    def init_frame(g, t) :
        g.set_source_rgb(1, 1, 1) # background colour
        g.paint()
        g.set_source_rgb(*colorsys.hsv_to_rgb(0.25, 0.9, 0.9)) # curve colour
    #end init_frame

(Note to be a draw procedure it has to take two arguments, even though it pays no attention
to the second one.) Now we need a way to ensure this is invoked immediately prior to the
lissa draw procedure for each frame. We can use draw_compose for this, to construct
a draw procedure which invokes its first argument followed by its second argument:

    anim_common.render_anim \
      (
        width = width,
        height = height,
        start_time = 0.0,
        end_time = anim_duration,
        frame_rate = frame_rate,
        draw_frame = anim_common.draw_compose(init_frame, lissa),
        overall_presetup = anim_init,
        out_dir = "frames",
        start_frame_nr = 1
      )

(Note the erasure of the background and setting of the pen colour in anim_init can now
be removed, since it is just repeating what is being done in init_frame.) If you try
playing back the new frames, you should now see a nicely-animating clean Lissajous curve.

Now, supposing we want to animate the colour of the curve. The draw procedure returned
by anim_lissa.make_draw doesn’t have any option for adjusting Cairo settings like the
pen size, colour etc; it simply uses whatever settings are currently in effect. To
control these settings in an animated fashion, we can add a suitable set_source_rgb
call to our init_frame procedure, and animate it based on the second argument (which we
were ignoring before). But since init_frame consists of nothing but Cairo calls, there
is a convenience routine to make it easier to define the whole procedure, complete
with animation:

    init_frame = anim_common.make_draw \
      (
        ("set_source_rgb", (1, 1, 1)),
        ("paint", ()),
        (
            "set_source_rgb",
            anim_common.hsv_to_rgb_interpolator
              (
                h = anim_common.linear_interpolator(0, anim_duration, 0, 1),
                s = 0.9,
                v = 0.9,
              )
        ),
      )

Now the exact same render_anim call as before will produce a Lissajous animation
where the curve goes through all the colours of the spectrum.

Hopefully that gives you the flavour of the framework, and how easy it is to do
some quite elaborate animations. By all means, delve further into it, try things out,
and have fun.
